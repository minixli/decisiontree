## Welcome to decisiontree

When encountered complex business logic with many if/else to do, I found it would always result in messy coding style. I tried async library but it also can't satisfy this situation gracefully, so I wrote decisiontree and open source it.



## Todo

This decision tree only supports true/false condition now.
