## Welcome to decisiontree

When encountered complex business logic with many if/else to do in NodeJS, it would always result in a messy coding style. I tried async library but it can't help solve this situation in a very graceful way, so I wrote a decision tree and open source it.

## Sample

The test is also a sample.

## Todo

This decision tree only supports true/false condition now.
